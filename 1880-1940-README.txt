Description

The corpus contains the years 1880–1948 of the Swedish sub-corpus of
the Newspaper and Periodical Corpus of the National Library of Finland
in the VRT (VeRticalized Text) format. The data has been digitized by
the National Library of Finland and converted to the VRT format and
annotated by FIN-CLARIN. The sentences within each page have been
scrambled to a random order for copyright reasons.

For some more information, please see the corpus metadata record at
http://urn.fi/urn:nbn:fi:lb-2020110302

The data has been annotated with an old version of Språkbanken’s Korp
corpus pipeline, with text-level metadata from the original data.

Please note that the text data has been programmatically recognized
from page images (OCR’d) and annotated without any manual correction,
so its quality varies significantly.

The data for each year is in a single file, named klk-sv-YYYY-s.vrt.

The data is encoded in UTF-8, with Unix-style line endings (LF). The
literal characters &, < and > have been encoded as the XML predefined
entities &amp;, &lt; and &gt;, and in structural attribute annotations
also " as &quot;.

Each token is on a line of its own, with the token and its annotation
attributes (positional attributes) separated by tabs. The attributes
are the following (in this order, also listed in the
“#vrt positional-attributes” comment at the beginning of the file):

  word: word form
  pos: part-of-speech tag
  msd: morpho-syntactic description
  lemma: base form(s)
  lex: lemgram(s) (lemma + part-of-speech code)
  saldo: lemma(s) with sense information
  prefix: prefix lemgram(s)
  suffix: suffix lemgram(s)
  ref: the number of the token in the sentence
  dephead: the number of the dependency head of the token
  deprel: dependency relation
  ocr: OCR confidence for the token (0.01…1.00)
  style: “_” (normal text), “subscript” or “superscript”

The attributes lemma, lex, saldo, prefix and suffix are feature-set
(multi-valued) attributes, in which the different values are separated
by vertical bars (|), with a leading and trailing vertical bar. A lone
vertical bar denotes the empty set (no value).

Structural divisions are marked with XML-style tags, with annotations
associated with each structure as attributes in the start tag. The
order of the annotation attributes may vary. The structures and their
annotation attributes are:
